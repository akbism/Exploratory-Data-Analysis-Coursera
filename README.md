# Exploratory Data Analysis, Coursera

This is project 1 for the course Exploratory Data Analysis in Coursera.

Source of Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Introduction: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

We are required to reconstruct four given plots- plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png using the programs Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R respectively.
The programs will read the data locally if available or it will download from the source if the required file household_power_consumption.txt is not available in the working directory.
